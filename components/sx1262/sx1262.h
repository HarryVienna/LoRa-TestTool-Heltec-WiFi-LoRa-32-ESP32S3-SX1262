 * Steps performed:
 * - Toggles NRESET pin (Hard Reset) to clear all internal radio registers,

 * - Sets the radio to STDBY_XOSC mode with optimal regulator settings.

 * @brief Retrieve the current RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) from the SX1262.
 *
 * Reads the radio's RSSI measurement and returns it as a signed 16-bit value representing
 * the signal power in dBm. Typical values are negative (for example, -120 .. 0 dBm) and
 * indicate the received signal strength.
 *
 * Preconditions:
 *  - The SX1262 must be initialized.
 *  - RSSI is meaningful when the radio is in receive mode or immediately after a packet has
 *    been received; calling this while the radio is inactive may return an undefined value.
 *  - Returns -999 on error (e.g., if read fails).
 *
 * @return int16_t
 *   RSSI in dBm (signed 16-bit) representing decibels relative to one milliwatt.
 *   Special value: -999 indicates an error or unavailable measurement.
 *
 * @note This function should not change the radio operating state.
 * @note **NOT thread-safe**: Serialize concurrent calls or ensure exclusive access to the radio.
